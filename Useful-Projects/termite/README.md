Current Development
===================

Starting in 2014, we have split Termite into two components:
  * **[Termite Data Server](http://github.com/uwdata/termite-data-server)** for processing the output of topic models and providing the content as a web service
  * **[Termite Visualizations](http://github.com/uwdata/termite-visualizations)** for visualizing topic model outputs in a web browser

Our goals are to:
  * support multiple topic modeling tools
  * reduce the cost of developing new visualizations through shared infrastructure
  * allow multiple visualizations to interact with any number of topic modeling software and with other visualizations

Please see the respective repositories for the latest software and additional information.
