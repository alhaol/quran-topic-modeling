When Abraham said: &quot;Show me, Lord, how You will raise the dead, &quot; He replied: &quot;Have you no faith?&quot; He said &quot;Yes, but just to reassure my heart.&quot; Allah said, &quot;Take four birds, draw them to you, and cut their bodies to pieces. Scatter them over the mountain-tops, then call them back. They will come swiftly to you. Know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.&quot;
