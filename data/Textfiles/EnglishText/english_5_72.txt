They do blaspheme who say: &quot;Allah is Christ the son of Mary.&quot; But said Christ: &quot;O Children of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.&quot; Whoever joins other gods with Allah,- Allah will forbid him the garden, and the Fire will be his abode. There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help.
