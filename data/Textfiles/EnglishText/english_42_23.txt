That is (the Bounty) whereof Allah gives Glad Tidings to His Servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say: &quot;No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin.&quot; And if any one earns any good, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (service).
