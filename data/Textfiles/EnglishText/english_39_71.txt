The Unbelievers will be led to Hell in crowd: until, when they arrive, there, its gates will be opened. And its keepers will say, &quot;Did not messengers come to you from among yourselves, rehearsing to you the Signs of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of This Day of yours?&quot; The answer will be: &quot;True: but the Decree of Punishment has been proved true against the Unbelievers!&quot;
