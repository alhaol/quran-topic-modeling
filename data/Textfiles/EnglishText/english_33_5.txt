Call them by (the names of) their fathers: that is juster in the sight of Allah. But if ye know not their fatherÂ´s (names, call them) your Brothers in faith, or your maulas. But there is no blame on you if ye make a mistake therein: (what counts is) the intention of your hearts: and Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
