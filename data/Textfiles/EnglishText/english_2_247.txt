Their Prophet said to them: &quot;Allah hath appointed Talut as king over you.&quot; They said: &quot;How can he exercise authority over us when we are better fitted than he to exercise authority, and he is not even gifted, with wealth in abundance?&quot; He said: &quot;Allah hath Chosen him above you, and hath gifted him abundantly with knowledge and bodily prowess: Allah Granteth His authority to whom He pleaseth. Allah careth for all, and He knoweth all things.&quot;
