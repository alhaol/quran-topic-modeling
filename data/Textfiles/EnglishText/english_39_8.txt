When some trouble toucheth man, he crieth unto his Lord, turning to Him in repentance: but when He bestoweth a favour upon him as from Himself, (man) doth forget what he cried and prayed for before, and he doth set up rivals unto Allah, thus misleading others from AllahÂ´s Path. Say, &quot;Enjoy thy blasphemy for a little while: verily thou art (one) of the Companions of the Fire!&quot;
