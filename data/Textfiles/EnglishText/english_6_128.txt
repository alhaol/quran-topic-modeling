One day will He gather them all together, (and say): &quot;O ye assembly of Jinns! Much (toll) did ye take of men.&quot; Their friends amongst men will say: &quot;Our Lord! we made profit from each other: but (alas!) we reached our term - which thou didst appoint for us.&quot; He will say: &quot;The Fire be your dwelling-place: you will dwell therein for ever, except as Allah willeth.&quot; for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.
