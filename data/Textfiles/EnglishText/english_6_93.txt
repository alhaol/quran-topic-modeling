Who can be more wicked than one who inventeth a lie against Allah, or saith, &quot;I have received inspiration,&quot; when he hath received none, or (again) who saith, &quot;I can reveal the like of what Allah hath revealed&quot;? If thou couldst but see how the wicked (do fare) in the flood of confusion at death! - the angels stretch forth their hands, (saying),&quot;Yield up your souls: this day shall ye receive your reward,- a penalty of shame, for that ye used to tell lies against Allah, and scornfully to reject of His signs!&quot;
