Is then He who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like any others)? And yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say: &quot;But name them! is it that ye will inform Him of something he knoweth not on earth, or is it (just) a show of words?&quot; Nay! to those who believe not, their pretence seems pleasing, but they are kept back (thereby) from the path. And those whom Allah leaves to stray, no one can guide.
