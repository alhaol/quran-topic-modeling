So if they dispute with thee, say: &quot;I have submitted My whole self to Allah and so have those who follow me.&quot; And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned: &quot;Do ye (also) submit yourselves?&quot; If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and in AllahÂ´s sight are (all) His servants.
