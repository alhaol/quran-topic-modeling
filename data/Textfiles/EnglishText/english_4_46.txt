Of the Jews there are those who displace words from their (right) places, and say: &quot;We hear and we disobey&quot;; and &quot;Hear what is not Heard&quot;; and &quot;RaÂ´ina&quot;; with a twist of their tongues and a slander to Faith. If only they had said: &quot;What hear and we obey&quot;; and &quot;Do hear&quot;; and &quot;Do look at us&quot;; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allah hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe.
