After (the excitement) of the distress, He sent down calm on a band of you overcome with slumber, while another band was stirred to anxiety by their own feelings, Moved by wrong suspicions of Allah-suspicions due to ignorance. They said: &quot;What affair is this of ours?&quot; Say thou: &quot;Indeed, this affair is wholly AllahÂ´s.&quot; They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee. They say (to themselves): &quot;If we had had anything to do with this affair, We should not have been in the slaughter here.&quot; Say: &quot;Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death&quot;; but (all this was) that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts.
