Hast thou not Turned thy vision to the Chiefs of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Moses? they said to a prophet (That was) among them: &quot;Appoint for us a king, that we May fight in the cause of Allah.&quot; He said: &quot;Is it not possible, if ye were commanded to fight, that that ye will not fight?&quot; They said: &quot;How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, seeing that we were turned out of our homes and our families?&quot; but when they were commanded to fight, they turned back, except a small band among them. But Allah Has full knowledge of those who do wrong.
