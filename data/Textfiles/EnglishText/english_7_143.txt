When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Lord addressed him, He said: &quot;O my Lord! show (Thyself) to me, that I may look upon thee.&quot; Allah said: &quot;By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me.&quot; When his Lord manifested His glory on the Mount, He made it as dust. And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: &quot;Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe.&quot;
