To the Thamud people (We sent) Salih, one of their own brethren: He said: &quot;O my people! worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. Now hath come unto you a clear (Sign) from your Lord! This she-camel of Allah is a Sign unto you: So leave her to graze in AllahÂ´s earth, and let her come to no harm, or ye shall be seized with a grievous punishment.
