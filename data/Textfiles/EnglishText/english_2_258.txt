Hast thou not Turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham About his Lord, because Allah had granted him power? Abraham said: &quot;My Lord is He Who Giveth life and death.&quot; He said: &quot;I give life and death&quot;. Said Abraham: &quot;But it is Allah that causeth the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause him to rise from the West.&quot; Thus was he confounded who (in arrogance) rejected faith. Nor doth Allah Give guidance to a people unjust.
