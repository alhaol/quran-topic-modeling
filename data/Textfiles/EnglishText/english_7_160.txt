We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: &quot;Strike the rock with thy staff&quot;: out of it there gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails, (saying): &quot;Eat of the good things We have provided for you&quot;: (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.
