It is He Who created you from a single person, and made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her (in love). When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it about (unnoticed). When she grows heavy, they both pray to Allah their Lord, (saying): &quot;If Thou givest us a goodly child, we vow we shall (ever) be grateful.&quot;
