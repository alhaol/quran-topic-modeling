And to Solomon (We made) the Wind (obedient): Its early morning (stride) was a month´s (journey), and its evening (stride) was a month´s (journey); and We made a Font of molten brass to flow for him; and there were Jinns that worked in front of him, by the leave of his Lord, and if any of them turned aside from our command, We made him taste of the Penalty of the Blazing Fire.
