The Unbelievers say: &quot;We shall neither believe in this scripture nor in (any) that (came) before it.&quot; Couldst thou but see when the wrong-doers will be made to stand before their Lord, throwing back the word (of blame) on one another! Those who had been despised will say to the arrogant ones: &quot;Had it not been for you, we should certainly have been believers!&quot;
