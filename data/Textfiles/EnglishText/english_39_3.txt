Is it not to Allah that sincere devotion is due? But those who take for protectors other than Allah (say): &quot;We only serve them in order that they may bring us nearer to Allah.&quot; Truly Allah will judge between them in that wherein they differ. But Allah guides not such as are false and ungrateful.
