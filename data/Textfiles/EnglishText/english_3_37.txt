Right graciously did her Lord accept her: He made her grow in purity and beauty: To the care of Zakariya was she assigned. Every time that he entered (Her) chamber to see her, He found her supplied with sustenance. He said: &quot;O Mary! Whence (comes) this to you?&quot; She said: &quot;From Allah: for Allah Provides sustenance to whom He pleases without measure.&quot;
