And remember Moses said to his people: &quot;O my people! Ye have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn (in repentance) to your Maker, and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker.&quot; Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness): For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
