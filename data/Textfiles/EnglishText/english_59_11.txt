Hast thou not observed the Hypocrites say to their misbelieving brethren among the People of the Book? - &quot;If ye are expelled, we too will go out with you, and we will never hearken to any one in your affair; and if ye are attacked (in fight) we will help you&quot;. But Allah is witness that they are indeed liars.
