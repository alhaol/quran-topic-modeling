Say: &quot;What thing is most weighty in evidence?&quot; Say: &quot;Allah is witness between me and you; This QurÂ´an hath been revealed to me by inspiration, that I may warn you and all whom it reaches. Can ye possibly bear witness that besides Allah there is another Allah?&quot; Say: &quot;Nay! I cannot bear witness!&quot; Say: &quot;But in truth He is the one Allah, and I truly am innocent of (your blasphemy of) joining others with Him.&quot;
