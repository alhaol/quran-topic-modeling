When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls, they say: &quot;In what (plight) Were ye?&quot; They reply: &quot;Weak and oppressed Were we in the earth.&quot; They say: &quot;Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to move yourselves away (From evil)?&quot; Such men will find their abode in Hell,- What an evil refuge! -
