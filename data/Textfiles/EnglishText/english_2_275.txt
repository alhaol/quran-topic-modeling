Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the Evil one by his touch Hath driven to madness. That is because they say: &quot;Trade is like usury,&quot; but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who after receiving direction from their Lord, desist, shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for Allah (to judge); but those who repeat (The offence) are companions of the Fire: They will abide therein (for ever).
