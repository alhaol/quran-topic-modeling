Those who avoid great sins and shameful deeds, only (falling into) small faults,- verily thy Lord is ample in forgiveness. He knows you well when He brings you out of the earth, And when ye are hidden in your mothersÂ´ wombs. Therefore justify not yourselves: He knows best who it is that guards against evil.
