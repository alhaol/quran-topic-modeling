O Messenger! let not those grieve thee, who race each other into unbelief: (whether it be) among those who say &quot;We believe&quot; with their lips but whose hearts have no faith; or it be among the Jews,- men who will listen to any lie,- will listen even to others who have never so much as come to thee. They change the words from their (right) times and places: they say, &quot;If ye are given this, take it, but if not, beware!&quot; If any one´s trial is intended by Allah, thou hast no authority in the least for him against Allah. For such - it is not Allah´s will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment.
