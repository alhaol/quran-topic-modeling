When the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his consorts, and she then divulged it (to another), and Allah made it known to him, he confirmed part thereof and repudiated a part. Then when he told her thereof, she said, &quot;Who told thee this? &quot;He said, &quot;He told me Who knows and is well-acquainted (with all things).&quot;
