O People of the Book! Now hath come unto you, making (things) clear unto you, Our Messenger, after the break in (the series of) our messengers, lest ye should say: &quot;There came unto us no bringer of glad tidings and no warner (from evil)&quot;: But now hath come unto you a bringer of glad tidings and a warner (from evil). And Allah hath power over all things.
