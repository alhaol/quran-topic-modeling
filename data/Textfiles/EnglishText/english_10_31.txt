Say: &quot;Who is it that sustains you (in life) from the sky and from the earth? or who is it that has power over hearing and sight? And who is it that brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living? and who is it that rules and regulates all affairs?&quot; They will soon say, &quot;Allah&quot;. Say, &quot;will ye not then show piety (to Him)?&quot;
