And hold fast, all together, by the rope which Allah (stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude AllahÂ´s favour on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His Grace, ye became brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus doth Allah make His Signs clear to you: That ye may be guided.
