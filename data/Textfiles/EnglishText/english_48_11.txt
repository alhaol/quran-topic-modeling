The desert Arabs who lagged behind will say to thee: &quot;We were engaged in (looking after) our flocks and herds, and our families: do thou then ask forgiveness for us.&quot; They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: &quot;Who then has any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with Allah, if His Will is to give you some loss or to give you some profit? But Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do.
