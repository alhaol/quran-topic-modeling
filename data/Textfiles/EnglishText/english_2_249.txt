When Talut set forth with the armies, he said: &quot;Allah will test you at the stream: if any drinks of its water, He goes not with my army: Only those who taste not of it go with me: A mere sip out of the hand is excused.&quot; but they all drank of it, except a few. When they crossed the river,- He and the faithful ones with him,- they said: &quot;This day We cannot cope with Goliath and his forces.&quot; but those who were convinced that they must meet Allah, said: &quot;How oft, by AllahÂ´s will, Hath a small force vanquished a big one? Allah is with those who steadfastly persevere.&quot;
