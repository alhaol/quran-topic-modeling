Or (take) the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins to its roofs. He said: &quot;Oh! how shall Allah bring it (ever) to life, after (this) its death?&quot; but Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: &quot;How long didst thou tarry (thus)?&quot; He said: (Perhaps) a day or part of a day.&quot; He said: &quot;Nay, thou hast tarried thus a hundred years; but look at thy food and thy drink; they show no signs of age; and look at thy donkey: And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people, Look further at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.&quot; When this was shown clearly to him, he said: &quot;I know that Allah hath power over all things.&quot;
