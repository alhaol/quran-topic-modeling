O ye who believe! Be ye helpers of Allah: As said Jesus the son of Mary to the Disciples, &quot;Who will be my helpers to (the work of) Allah?&quot; Said the disciples, &quot;We are AllahÂ´s helpers!&quot; then a portion of the Children of Israel believed, and a portion disbelieved: But We gave power to those who believed, against their enemies, and they became the ones that prevailed.
