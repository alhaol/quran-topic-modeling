And behold! Allah will say: &quot;O Jesus the son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men, worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of AllahÂ´?&quot; He will say: &quot;Glory to Thee! never could I say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, thou wouldst indeed have known it. Thou knowest what is in my heart, Thou I know not what is in Thine. For Thou knowest in full all that is hidden.
