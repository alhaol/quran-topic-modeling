Remember Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them, and said: &quot;No one among men can overcome you this day, while I am near to you&quot;: But when the two forces came in sight of each other, he turned on his heels, and said: &quot;Lo! I am clear of you; lo! I see what ye see not; Lo! I fear Allah: for Allah is strict in punishment.&quot;
