It is not required of thee (O Messenger), to set them on the right path, but Allah sets on the right path whom He pleaseth. Whatever of good ye give benefits your own souls, and ye shall only do so seeking the &quot;Face&quot; of Allah. Whatever good ye give, shall be rendered back to you, and ye shall not Be dealt with unjustly.
