One Day will the Hypocrites- men and women - say to the Believers: &quot;Wait for us! Let us borrow (a Light) from your Light!&quot; It will be said: &quot;Turn ye back to your rear! then seek a Light (where ye can)!&quot; So a wall will be put up betwixt them, with a gate therein. Within it will be Mercy throughout, and without it, all alongside, will be (Wrath and) Punishment!
