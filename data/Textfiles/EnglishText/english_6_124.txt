When there comes to them a sign (from Allah), They say: &quot;We shall not believe until we receive one (exactly) like those received by AllahÂ´s messengers.&quot; Allah knoweth best where (and how) to carry out His mission. Soon will the wicked be overtaken by humiliation before Allah, and a severe punishment, for all their plots.
