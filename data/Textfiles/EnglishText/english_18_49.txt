And the Book (of Deeds) will be placed (before you); and thou wilt see the sinful in great terror because of what is (recorded) therein; they will say, &quot;Ah! woe to us! what a Book is this! It leaves out nothing small or great, but takes account thereof!&quot; They will find all that they did, placed before them: And not one will thy Lord treat with injustice.
