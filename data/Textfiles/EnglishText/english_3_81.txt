Behold! Allah took the covenant of the prophets, saying: &quot;I give you a Book and Wisdom; then comes to you a messenger, confirming what is with you; do ye believe in him and render him help.&quot; Allah said: &quot;Do ye agree, and take this my Covenant as binding on you?&quot; They said: &quot;We agree.&quot; He said: &quot;Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.&quot;
