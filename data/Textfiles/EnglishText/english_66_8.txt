O ye who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance: In the hope that your Lord will remove from you your ills and admit you to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow,- the Day that Allah will not permit to be humiliated the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their Light will run forward before them and by their right hands, while they say, &quot;Our Lord! Perfect our Light for us, and grant us Forgiveness: for Thou hast power over all things.&quot;
