Then there are among men such as say, &quot;We believe in Allah&quot;; but when they suffer affliction in (the cause of) Allah, they treat menÂ´s oppression as if it were the Wrath of Allah! And if help comes (to thee) from thy Lord, they are sure to say, &quot;We have (always) been with you!&quot; Does not Allah know best all that is in the hearts of all creation?
