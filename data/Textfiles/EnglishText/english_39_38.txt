If indeed thou ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth, they would be sure to say, &quot;Allah&quot;. Say: &quot;See ye then? the things that ye invoke besides Allah,- can they, if Allah wills some Penalty for me, remove His Penalty?- Or if He wills some Grace for me, can they keep back his Grace?&quot; Say: &quot;Sufficient is Allah for me! In Him trust those who put their trust.&quot;
