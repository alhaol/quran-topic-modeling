For each (such person) there are (angels) in succession, before and behind him: They guard him by command of Allah. Allah does not change a people´s lot unless they change what is in their hearts. But when (once) Allah willeth a people´s punishment, there can be no turning it back, nor will they find, besides Him, any to protect.
