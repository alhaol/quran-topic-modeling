Is one who worships devoutly during the hour of the night prostrating himself or standing (in adoration), who takes heed of the Hereafter, and who places his hope in the Mercy of his Lord - (like one who does not)? Say: &quot;Are those equal, those who know and those who do not know? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition.
