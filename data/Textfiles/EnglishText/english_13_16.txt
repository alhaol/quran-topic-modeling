Say: &quot;Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?&quot; Say: &quot;(It is) Allah.&quot; Say: &quot;Do ye then take (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as have no power either for good or for harm to themselves?&quot; Say: &quot;Are the blind equal with those who see? Or the depths of darkness equal with light?&quot; Or do they assign to Allah partners who have created (anything) as He has created, so that the creation seemed to them similar? Say: &quot;Allah is the Creator of all things: He is the One, the Supreme and Irresistible.&quot;
