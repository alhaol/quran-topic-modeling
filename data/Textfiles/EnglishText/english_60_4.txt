There is for you an excellent example (to follow) in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people: &quot;We are clear of you and of whatever ye worship besides Allah: we have rejected you, and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred for ever,- unless ye believe in Allah and Him alone&quot;: But not when Abraham said to his father: &quot;I will pray for forgiveness for thee, though I have no power (to get) aught on thy behalf from Allah.&quot; (They prayed): &quot;Our Lord! in Thee do we trust, and to Thee do we turn in repentance: to Thee is (our) Final Goal.
