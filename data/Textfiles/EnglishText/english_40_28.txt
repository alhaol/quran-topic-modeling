A believer, a man from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his faith, said: &quot;Will ye slay a man because he says, ´My Lord is Allah´?- when he has indeed come to you with Clear (Signs) from your Lord? and if he be a liar, on him is (the sin of) his lie: but, if he is telling the Truth, then will fall on you something of the (calamity) of which he warns you: Truly Allah guides not one who transgresses and lies!
