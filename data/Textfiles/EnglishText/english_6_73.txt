It is He who created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): the day He saith, &quot;Be,&quot; behold! it is. His word is the truth. His will be the dominion the day the trumpet will be blown. He knoweth the unseen as well as that which is open. For He is the Wise, well acquainted (with all things).
