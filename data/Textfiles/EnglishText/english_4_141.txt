(These are) the ones who wait and watch about you: if ye do gain a victory from Allah, they say: &quot;Were we not with you?&quot;- but if the unbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): &quot;Did we not gain an advantage over you, and did we not guard you from the believers?&quot; but Allah will judge betwixt you on the Day of Judgment. And never will Allah grant to the unbelievers a way (to triumphs) over the believers.
