Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Signs? For such, their portion appointed must reach them from the Book (of decrees): until, when our messengers (of death) arrive and take their souls, they say: &quot;Where are the things that ye used to invoke besides Allah?&quot; They will reply, &quot;They have left us in the lurch,&quot; And they will bear witness against themselves, that they had rejected Allah.
